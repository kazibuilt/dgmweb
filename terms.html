Further, to the extent that any of the Labs, Pharmacies, or Providers may be enrolled in federal, state, or private payor healthcare programs, the means through which the services and products are provided or made accessible through the Service typically precludes such services and products from being covered benefits under these programs. The healthcare services provided by the Medical Providers through the Platform are not medically necessary services and are solely for health optimization and wellness. By choosing to use the Service, you are specifically choosing to obtain products and services on a cash basis outside of any federal, state, or private payor healthcare program. Thus, you are solely responsible for the costs of any service or product provided to you.</div>

We encourage you to talk to a genetic counselor to help you understand your results and testing options.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Some people feel a little anxious about getting genetic health results and you may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate. This is normal. If you feel very anxious, you should speak to your physician or a genetic counselor prior to collecting your sample for testing. Additionally, you may discover things about yourself that trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g., your father is not genetically your father, surprising facts related to your ancestry, or that someone with your genotype may have a higher than average chance of developing a specific condition or disease).</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory process may result in errors. The laboratory may not be able to process your sample if your sample does not contain a sufficient volume of DNA.</div>

The telehealth services are not a substitute for in-person health care in all cases. In order to use the Service, you will be required to review and agree to an informed consent regarding the use of telehealth (the “<strong>Patient Consent</strong>”) that will be provided to you by the Medical Groups and Providers through the Platform. You agree that Superpower is a third-party beneficiary of the Patient Consent and has the right to enforce it against you.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">In some cases, the Service may not be the most appropriate way for you to provide information to, communicate with, or seek medical care and treatment from a healthcare provider.

In such a case, you may receive notification stating that you will be unable to use the Service for the particular issue you submitted and providing additional information regarding next steps.</div>

          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">All products offered for sale by Superpower are subject to availability and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order or reject all or any part of an order without prior notice. In the event of an error, we reserve the right to correct the error and revise your order accordingly (which includes charging the correct price) or to cancel the order and refund any amount charged. Prices for products are subject to change at any time, but changes will not affect any order for products you have already placed. You are responsible for any applicable sales, use, duty, customs or other governmental taxes, levies or fees (“<strong>Taxes</strong>”) due with respect to your purchase of products or services through our Service. We will collect applicable Taxes if we determine we have a duty to collect Taxes. We will present an estimate of Taxes we collect at checkout, except where we have clearly stated in writing that a price includes Taxes. The actual Taxes charged may be adjusted from the amount shown at checkout. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes in tax rates. We are not required to, and do not, collect Taxes in all states. You may have a duty to directly report and pay Taxes if we do not collect such Taxes.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Only valid payment methods acceptable to us may be used to complete a purchase via the Service. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use your designated payment method.

          <h4 class="h6 text-white"><strong>​Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver</strong></h4>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL CLAIM, DISPUTE OR OTHER CONTROVERSY BETWEEN YOU AND SUPERPOWER OR YOU AND ANY OF THE SUPERPOWER PARTIES OR ANY MEDICAL GROUP OR PROVIDER ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING IN ANY WAY TO SUPERPOWER, THE PLATFORM, THE CONTENT OR THE SERVICE, OR ANY OTHER SUPERPOWER GOODS, SERVICES OR ADVERTISING, INCLUDING CONTROVERSIES RELATING TO THE APPLICABILITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR VALIDITY OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY “<strong>DISPUTES</strong>”), SHALL BE RESOLVED IN CONFIDENTIAL BINDING ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BEFORE ONE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATOR FROM THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), RATHER THAN IN A COURT, AS DESCRIBED HEREIN. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE AAA’S COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND, IF THE ARBITRATOR DEEMS THEM APPLICABLE, THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (COLLECTIVELY “<strong>RULES AND PROCEDURES</strong>”). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">​Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">​Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA’s fee schedule, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case Superpower will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. Superpower also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs imposed by the AAA. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">The arbitration shall be conducted in Los Angeles, California, except that, in the event Los Angeles, California is not within 100 miles of your residence, the arbitration may be conducted within 100 miles of your residence, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">​Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Dispute arises from: (a) a violation of either party’s intellectual property rights in any manner; (b) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorized use or a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; and/or (c) any claim for equitable relief; then you and Superpower agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a state or federal court in Los Angeles, California, and both parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such proceedings. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Disputes that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration as long as such action remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">​ALL DISPUTES SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. NO PARTY MAY BRING ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS PROCEEDING. THE CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED OR JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim or request for relief, then such claim or request for relief (and only that claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, subject to the parties’ respective rights to appeal the decision. All other claims or requests for relief shall be arbitrated. The parties agree that any claims or requests for relief that are severed from an arbitration may not proceed in litigation and shall be stayed until all claims between the parties remaining in arbitration are finally resolved. The parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Los Angeles, California for purposes of resolving any claims or requests for relief severed from arbitration pursuant to this paragraph.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">​You can opt out of the provisions of this Agreement that require the arbitration of Disputes within 30 days of the date that you first agree to any version of this Agreement that requires arbitration of disputes with Superpower.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if we make any future material modification to any provisions of this Agreement that govern the arbitration or resolution of Disputes, such changes will not apply to any Dispute between you and us for which either party had previously provided a written Notice of Dispute to the other in accordance with this paragraph. Further, if we make any future material changes to the provisions of this Agreement that govern the arbitration or resolution of Disputes, you may reject such changes by sending a written notice of your rejection decision to us at compliance@superpower.com, ATTN: Arbitration Opt-Out within 30 days of the effective date of such modifications.</div>
