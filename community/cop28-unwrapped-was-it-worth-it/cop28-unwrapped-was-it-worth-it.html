of the most pivotal in all 28 years of the conference&#x27;s history. For the first time ever, all major discussions seemed to center on a singular agenda item: the phase-out of fossil fuels. Emotions ran high leading up to the event, given the world&#x27;s record-breaking temperatures and the impact of war that was being witnessed in parallel. During these unprecedented times, our expectations for COP were to address the intersectional impacts of war, fossil fuels, and rising temperatures on climate change. The headlines blared controversies, from questioning nations&#x27; intentions to the staggering amount of lobbyists present - four times more than the year before!</p><figure class="FigCaption_FigCaption__AK10a span-2 subgrid false"><div class="Parallax_Parallax__rIHh3 FigCaption_image__Lci3x span-1"><div style="transform:scale(1.1) translateZ(0)"><div style="transform:none"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1348" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" srcSet="../../_next/image/1715653451-cop28-unwrapped.jpg 1x, ../../_next/image/1715653451-cop28-unwrapped.jpg 2x" src="../../_next/image/1715653451-cop28-unwrapped.jpg"/></div></div></div><figcaption class="FigCaption_caption__L1ufA col-pos-1 ff-p-16">Kritika &amp; Nuha, Co-Founders of erthos </figcaption></figure><h2 class="span-1 ff-p-24 RichStructuredText_heading__htylY RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">Our perspective?</h2><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">Despite monumental efforts to address critical issues this year, like phasing out fossil fuels, establishing a loss and damage fund, and securing climate financing, we believe we&#x27;re still lagging behind in the urgent actions necessary to safeguard future generations.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz"><strong>TLDR:</strong></p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">Developing nations continue to face biases and unfairness in climate discussions.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">The focus on methane reduction and nature-based solutions marks a crucial industry milestone.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">We urge stronger climate leadership from Canada, given its significant ties to fossil fuel production and high emissions per capita.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">COP28&#x27;s emotional buildup signifies its potential for change but underscores the need for more than incremental progress.</p><figure class="FigCaption_FigCaption__AK10a span-2 subgrid false"><div class="Parallax_Parallax__rIHh3 FigCaption_image__Lci3x span-1"><div style="transform:scale(1.1) translateZ(0)"><div style="transform:none"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1488" height="966" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" srcSet="../../_next/image/1715653538-cop28-unwrapped-1.jpg 1x, ../../_next/image/1715653538-cop28-unwrapped-1.jpg 2x" src="../../_next/image/1715653538-cop28-unwrapped-1.jpg"/></div></div></div><figcaption class="FigCaption_caption__L1ufA col-pos-1 ff-p-16">The Sustainability Pavillion at COP28</figcaption></figure><hr/><h2 class="span-1 ff-p-24 RichStructuredText_heading__htylY RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">Moments that moved us</h2><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">We had the exclusive opportunity to access both the Blue and Green Zones to participate in negotiations, meet key industry leaders, and witness groundbreaking events.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz"><strong>Looking back on our experience, here are our top 4 favorite moments:</strong></p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">#1: Al Gore’s Keynote</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">Al Gore delivered a keynote that stood out for us.

The Indigenous representative from Peru pleaded for an end to fossil fuel production in her community, sharing firsthand experiences that sent shivers through the room.

Negotiations swayed towards entirely eliminating language around phasing out fossil fuels from the final text, sparking massive protests and strong opposition. Eventually, the final text showed minor improvements, emphasizing emissions reduction and reaching net-zero by 2050. While the specific &quot;phase-out&quot; wasn&#x27;t explicit, the text strongly urged nations to take immediate action and included targets to accelerate and significantly reduce non-CO2 emissions globally, particularly methane emissions by 2030.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz"><strong>Loss &amp; Damage Fund</strong></p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">COP28 witnessed a landmark agreement to support vulnerable nations grappling with the severe impacts of climate change. The fund, initially managed by the World Bank, garnered the first pledges from nations in Dubai, totaling over $700 million. Witnessing this historic moment on day one was powerful. However, let&#x27;s put this into perspective: to effectively address the true loss and damage effects, we require over $400 billion annually. Disappointingly, despite being one of the largest producers of oil and gas, the US contributed a mere $17.5 <strong>million</strong> to the fund. In contrast, it’s estimated that US taxpayers pay about $20 <strong>billion</strong> dollars every year to the fossil fuel industry.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz"><strong>Adaptation &amp; Nature</strong></p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">Continuing from last year, this COP emphasized strategies for adapting to climate change impacts. Notably, the final text directly mentioned nature-based solutions in the Global Goal on Adaptation. A promising 2030 deforestation goal was also part of the text, ensuring that diversity in solutions is considered. It was exciting to see the growing acknowledgment that achieving climate goals demands innovative technology rooted in nature and a bio-based economy, crucial for transitioning towards sustainable cities and supply chains, a driving force for us at erthos.</p><figure class="FigCaption_FigCaption__AK10a span-2 subgrid false"><div class="Parallax_Parallax__rIHh3 FigCaption_image__Lci3x span-1"><div style="transform:scale(1.1) translateZ(0)"><div style="transform:none"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1412" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" srcSet="../../_next/image/1715653808-cop28-unwrapped-5.jpg 1x, ../../_next/image/1715653808-cop28-unwrapped-5.jpg 2x" src="../../_next/image/1715653808-cop28-unwrapped-5.jpg"/></div></div></div><figcaption class="FigCaption_caption__L1ufA col-pos-1 ff-p-16">Blue Zone Speaker Room at COP28</figcaption></figure><hr/><h2 class="span-1 ff-p-24 RichStructuredText_heading__htylY RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">Main Takeaways</h2><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">Reflecting on COP28, a few themes remain top of mind as it relates to the climate crisis:</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz"><strong>The Role of Developing Nations:</strong> As young entrepreneurs invested in climate action, our participation in high-level state discussions and engagement with youth activists provided invaluable insights into persisting biases and the evident lack of fairness towards developing nations. Erthos is situated at the intersection of business and climate, and we feel a profound sense of responsibility to foster inclusivity. We are committed to leveraging our platform to amplify the powerful voices of youth and marginalized communities.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz"><strong>The Role of Biomaterials: </strong>The concept of a just transition and nature-based solutions resonated deeply with us. The emphasis on targets around methane gas reduction and the role of bioplastics signals a pivotal moment for our industry. We will continue to champion sustainable materials and promote responsible consumption.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz"><strong>The Role of Canada: </strong>Despite Canada&#x27;s support for renewable ecosystems, its level of investment in critical pledges like the loss and damage fund was disappointing. Considering Canada&#x27;s significant global presence in fossil fuel production and its GHG emissions ranking per capita, we advocate for a more assertive leadership role from Canada in addressing climate issues and advancing next-generation solutions that promote a bioeconomy.</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz"><strong>The Role of COP28:</strong> The heightened emotions leading up to COP28 underscored the potential of platforms like this to ignite a significant movement. However, the urgency of our current climate crisis demands more than incremental change. With wildfires raging, ecosystems on the brink of extinction, cities facing disproportionate destruction, and record-breaking temperatures, we can&#x27;t afford gradual shifts. We urgently require accelerated action like never before.Looking Ahead</p><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">For erthos, COP28 was monumental. It deepened our understanding of the global climate landscape, reignited our commitment to sustainability, and intensified our urgency for accelerated action. As we continue innovating sustainable materials, our mission remains steadfast—to contribute significantly to a greener and more sustainable future.</p><hr/><h2 class="span-1 ff-p-24 RichStructuredText_heading__htylY RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">Stay connected</h2><p class="span-1 ff-p-16 RichStructuredText_paragraph__GM9TZ RichStructuredText_content-col__DZ6Pz">At erthos, we&#x27;re committed to building innovative and regenerative materials to create a planet free from plastic pollution.
