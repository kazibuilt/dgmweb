To the extent Superpower is deemed a &quot;business associate&quot; however, and solely in its role as a business associate, Superpower, may be subject to certain provisions of HIPAA with respect to &quot;protected health information,&quot; as defined under HIPAA, that you provide to Superpower, the Labs, Pharmacies, Medical Groups or the Healthcare Providers (&quot;<strong class="bold-text">PHI</strong>&quot;). In addition, any medical or health information that you provide that is subject to specific protections under applicable state laws (collectively, with PHI, “<strong>Protected Information</strong>”), will be used and disclosed only in accordance with such applicable laws. However, any information that does not constitute Protected Information under applicable laws may be used or disclosed in any manner permitted under this Privacy Policy. Protected Information does not include information that has been de-identified in accordance with applicable laws.</div>

          <h4 class="h6 text-white"><strong>What are cookies and similar technologies?</strong></h4>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Cookies are small text files placed by a website and stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server. </div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Web beacons are electronic images (also called single-pixel or clear GIFs) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content. We also include web beacons in our email messages or newsletters to tell us if you open and act on them. </div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Mobile analytics and advertising IDs are generated by operating systems for mobile devices (iOS and Android) and can be accessed and used by apps in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. Our apps contain software that enables us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to access these mobile IDs.</div>

This data is used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our websites and apps perform, track your interaction with the site or app, develop inferences, deliver and tailor interest-based advertising, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. We and/or our partners also share the data we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to stop, you can do so by following the directions in that message or by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below. These choices do not apply to certain informational communications including surveys and mandatory service communications.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">There are certain browser and platform controls that may be available to you in order to opt-out from or otherwise control targeted advertising as described below. You can use the opt-out controls offered by the organizations our advertising partners may participate in, which you can access at:</div>
          <ul role="list" class="list">

        <div class="mission-content">
          <h4 class="h6 text-white"><strong>Browser or platform controls.</strong></h4>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Cookie controls. </strong>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Global Privacy Control. </strong>Some browsers and browser extensions support privacy controls that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating your choice to opt-out from certain types of data processing, including data sales and/or targeted advertising, as specified by applicable law. When we detect such a signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your choices indicated by a privacy setting or similar control that is recognized by regulation or otherwise widely acknowledged as a valid opt-out preference signal.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Do Not Track. </strong>Some browsers include a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (DNT) setting that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Unlike the privacy control described above, there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal; therefore, our websites do not respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the privacy controls, cookie controls, and advertising controls described above.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Mobile advertising ID controls. </strong>iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Email web beacons. </strong>Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including web beacons, which prevents the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Except for the automated controls described above, if you send us a request to exercise your rights or these choices, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline requests in certain cases. For example, we may decline requests where granting the request would be prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or other rights of another person, would reveal a trade secret or other confidential information, or would interfere with a legal or business obligation that requires retention or use of the data. Further, we may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Finally, please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to your “personal information,” which is separate from “medical information” or “protected health information.” To understand our information practices and your rights with respect to such information, visit the Medical Groups Notice of Privacy Practices.</div>

          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">In connection with any transaction that you conduct through the Service (e.g., the purchase or sale of any products or services on or through the Service), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to the transaction, including, without limitation, your credit card number and expiration date, your billing address, your shipping address, your phone number and/or your email address. By submitting such information, you grant Superpower without charge the irrevocable, unencumbered, universe-wide and perpetual right to provide such information to third parties (e.g., payment processing companies, buyers on the Service, sellers on the Service) for the purpose of facilitating the transaction.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">All credit card, debit card and other monetary transactions on or through the Service occur through an online payment processing application(s) accessible through the Service. The online payment processing application for the Platform, except the Superpower Marketplace powered by Shopify, is provided by Superpower&#x27; third-party online payment processing vendor, Stripe (&quot;<strong>Stripe</strong>&quot;). Additional information about Stripe, its privacy policy and its information security measures (collectively, the “<strong>Stripe Policies</strong>&quot;) should be available on the Stripe website located at <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a> or by contacting Stipe directly. Reference is made to the Stripe Policies for informational purposes only and are in no way incorporated into or made a part of this Privacy Policy. Superpower&#x27; relationship with Stripe, if any, is merely contractual in nature, as Stripe nothing more than a third-party vendor to Superpower, and is in no way subject to Superpower&#x27; direction or control; thus, their relationship is not, and should not be construed as, one of fiduciaries, franchisors-franchisees, agents-principals, employers-employees, partners, joint venturers or the like.</div>

          <h4 class="h6 text-white"><strong>California Residents</strong></h4>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you have certain rights with respect to that information.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Notice at Collection. </strong>At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the categories of personal information and sensitive personal information to be collected, the purposes for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is sold or shared, and how long such information is retained. You can find those details in this Privacy Policy.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Right to Know. </strong>You have a right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected about you.  You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information.  Note that we have provided much of this information in this Privacy Policy. You may make such a “request to know” by emailing us at compliance@superpower.com.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Rights to Request Correction or Deletion. </strong>You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate personal information and that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. To make a request to correct or delete, email us at compliance@superpower.com.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Right to Opt-Out / “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”. </strong>You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” or “sharing” of personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Note that the CCPA defines “sell,” “share,” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this privacy statement may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under those definitions. In particular, we let advertising and analytics providers collect identifiers (IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs), activity data (browsing, clicks, app usage), device data, and geolocation data through our sites and apps when you use our online services, but do not “sell” or “share” any other types of personal information. If you do not wish for us or our partners to “sell” or “share” personal information relating to your visits to our sites for advertising purposes, you can make your request by emailing <a href="mailto:compliance@superpower.com">compliance@superpower.com</a>. If you opt-out using these choices, we will not share or make available such personal information in ways that are considered a “sale” or “sharing” under the CCPA.  However, we will continue to make available to our partners (acting as our service providers) some personal information to help us perform advertising-related functions. Further, using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” or “shared” personal information or stop all interest-based advertising.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 18 years of age.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70"><strong>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. </strong>You have a right to limit our use of sensitive personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services or goods you request or as otherwise permitted by law.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Further, to provide, correct, or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account.</div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Finally, you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights set out in the CCPA. </div>
          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“<strong>California Customers</strong>”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  </div>

          <div class="body-text text-color-white _70">When using the Service, you may choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features you are able to use or may prevent you from using the Service all together.

Please note that even if you opt out, we may still send you Service-related communications. We do not currently respond to web browser &quot;do not track&quot; signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate.

Such supplements, amendments and other modifications will be posted on this or a similar page of the Service, and shall be deemed effective as of the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date; provided, however, that Superpower will notify you and/or require you to accept the updated Privacy Policy if the supplemented, amended or otherwise modified Privacy Policy implements material changes from Superpower&#x27; then-current Privacy Policy.
